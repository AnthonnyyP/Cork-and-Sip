### Description:

Maybe you're a sommelier, maybe you're like "sommel-what? I don't even know what that is." Doesn't matter, everybody speaks wine, am I right? Maybe? No? Well, either way, we would like to introduce you to Cork & Sip. Cork & Sip is a full-stack, PostgreSQL/Django/Python website incorporating full CRUD, integrated user authentication and authorization, as well as entity relationship models where wine enthusiasts can explore the world of wine, start their own collections called 'cellars', add wines that they want added to the list of wines available, and experience new wines by registering for tastings. Our design has four models: a user model, a wine model, a collection model, and a model for tastings.

#### **_Minimum Viable Product (MVP)_**:
1. Your ReadMe should have your group members names, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
2. Your project must include a minimum of 3 Django Models (models).
3. Your project must have at least one 1 to MANY or MANY to MANY association.
4. Your project must have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model.
5. Your project must integrate User Authentication utilizing protected routes.
6. Your project must have at least 80 meaningful git commits - roughly 20+ per member utilizing branches and merging. You should be committing your changes to your branch every time you build a new feature, merging, and pulling them as a group.
7. Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
8. Your project must be deployed.

#### **_Future Updates_**:

1. The Wine Searcher [API](https://www.wine-searcher.com/trade/ws-api) will be implemented to allow users to query for different wines within the Cork & Sip vineyards collection and to see if they'll be available during the event tasting. 
2. Image Upload will be implemented for adding a wine, the guest profile, and images will be showcased on the "All Wines" page in addition to their name and description.
